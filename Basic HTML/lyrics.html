            Hey!
            
            In her heart theres a hole
            theres a black mark on her soul
            in her hands is my heart
            she wont let it go till its scarred
            try to breathe but i cant 
            cuz the air she feeds me is damned 
            gonna touch like a thorn
            cuz the girl she hiding horns......

            she got blood cold as ice
            and a heart made of stone
            but she keeps me alive 
            she's beast down my bones 
            she gets everything she wants when she gets me alone, like its nothing........
            she got two little horns and the get me in a little bit....

            she's the fire in the sins
            and it burns breathing her in 
            all is left is suicide and i sell my soul for the high
            truth be told i dont mind cuz she has my paradise 
            she can crush every hope got her heels stopping by throat........

            she got blood cold as ice
            and a heart made of stone
            but she keeps me alive 
            she's beast down my bones 
            she gets everything she wants when she gets me alone, like its nothing........
            she got two little horns and the get me in a little bit....

            she gots horns like a devil pointed at me and theres no where to run from the fire she breaths
            she gots horns like a devil pointed at me and theres no where to run from the fire she breaths
            she gots horns like a devil pointed at me and theres no where to run from the fire she breaths!
            
            Hey!
            Come on!
            She got two little horns and they are getting me a little bit!
